## Why Choose Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

### 1. Durability and Longevity

Kuningan, or brass, is renowned for its robustness and resistance to corrosion. When used in stove burners, it ensures the product remains in excellent condition over years of usage. Unlike other materials that may degrade over time, brass burners withstand frequent heating cycles, making them ideal for busy households and commercial kitchens alike.

Brass burners are designed to distribute heat evenly across your cookware. This feature allows for consistent cooking results, whether you're boiling, frying, or simmering. Proper heat distribution reduces fuel consumption, saving you money in the long run.

## What is a Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

A burner kompor gas kuningan is a type of gas stove burner made primarily from kuningan (brass). Brass is renowned for its excellent heat conduction, corrosion resistance, and aesthetic appeal.

The warm golden hue of kuningan lends a vintage and sophisticated look to your kitchen. Whether you prefer a traditional or modern style, a brass burner adds a touch of elegance.

### Easy Maintenance

Kuningan burns are relatively easy to clean. Regular wiping with a soft cloth and mild cleaning agents keeps the burners looking new and functioning efficiently.

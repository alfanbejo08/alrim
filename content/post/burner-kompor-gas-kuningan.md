## What is Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

Burner kompor gas kuningan is a type of gas stove that features burners made from kuningan (brass), a metal known for its durability, corrosion resistance, and excellent heat conduction. This type of stove is popular in Indonesian households and food establishments due to its robustness and efficiency. The kuningan material ensures even heat distribution, allowing for better cooking results and prolonged product lifespan.

## Why Choose Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

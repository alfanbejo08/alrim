### Heat Efficiency
Brass burners distribute heat evenly, ensuring your dishes are cooked uniformly. This feature is especially important for delicate recipes or when cooking large quantities.

### Classic Aesthetic
The warm golden color of kuningan adds a vintage charm to any kitchen, blending both traditional and rustic styles seamlessly.

### Easy Maintenance
Brass surfaces are relatively simple to clean. Regular wiping and polishing keep the stove looking shiny and new for years.

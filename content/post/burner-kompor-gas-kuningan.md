## What Is Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

**Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan** refers to a type of gas stove made with components or accents crafted from **kuningan**, the Indonesian term for **brass**. Brass, a blend of copper and zinc, is a popular material choice in kitchen appliances because of its durability, corrosion resistance, and attractive golden hue. These stoves typically feature a sturdy construction with a traditional or contemporary design, making them suitable for various kitchen styles.

The term “Kompor Gas Kuningan” highlights the combination of gas-powered burners with the elegant and timeless appeal of brass, creating a product that balances functionality with aesthetic sophistication.

The golden brass accents add a touch of elegance to any kitchen, making it not just a cooking appliance but also a decorative element. Its classic yet trendy look can complement traditional Indonesian kitchens or modern interiors looking for a vintage charm.

### Durability and Longevity

Brass is renowned for its durability. When used in stove components like burners and knobs, it resists corrosion and withstands high temperatures. This ensures that your Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan remains functional and aesthetic over long periods, even with regular use.

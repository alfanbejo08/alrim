Burners made from high-quality brass are excellent conductors of heat. This ensures an even flame distribution on your cookware, leading to more efficient cooking and better results, whether you’re boiling, frying, or grilling.

Thanks to their smooth surface and corrosion resistance, kuningan burners are relatively easy to clean. Regular wiping with a soft cloth is usually sufficient to keep them looking pristine and functioning optimally.

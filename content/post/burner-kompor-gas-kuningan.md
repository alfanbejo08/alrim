## What Is a Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

A Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan is a traditional gas stove made primarily from kuningan (brass), a metal renowned for its durability, corrosion resistance, and excellent heat conduction. The “Burner” refers to the burning component where liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or natural gas is combusted to generate heat for cooking. These stoves are typically used in Indonesian households and small restaurants, valued for their robustness and aesthetic appeal.

The use of kuningan gives the stove an elegant, vintage look that can complement various kitchen décors. Moreover, due to its excellent heat conductivity, it ensures efficient cooking with minimal gas wastage. Many models feature multiple burners, adjustable flame controls, and sturdy knobs, making them versatile and user-friendly.

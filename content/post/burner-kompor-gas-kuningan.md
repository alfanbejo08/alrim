## What is a Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

A **Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan** is a type of gas stove featuring burners made primarily from kuningan (brass). Often used in residential and commercial kitchens, these burners are celebrated for their durability, excellent heat conduction, and aesthetic appeal.

The golden hue of kuningan adds a vintage or classic charm to your kitchen setup. Its decorative look makes it not only a functional item but also a visual enhancement.

### Easy Maintenance
Burners made from kuningan are relatively easy to clean. Regular wiping with a soft cloth maintains their shine and prevents build-up of grease and grime.

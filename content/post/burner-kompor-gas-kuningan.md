## What is Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

*Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan* refers to a traditional-style gas stove with burners made from or featuring accents of *kuningan* (brass). Known for its metallic finish and sturdy construction, this type of stove is popular for its aesthetic appeal and long-lasting performance.

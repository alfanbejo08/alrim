### Aesthetic Appeal

The golden hue of brass adds a vintage, yet sophisticated touch to your kitchen decor. It pairs well with both traditional and modern styles, giving your culinary space a warm, inviting atmosphere.

Brass is known for its exceptional durability. Unlike painted or coated stoves, a *Kompor Gas Kuningan* resists rust and corrosion, especially when properly maintained. This makes it ideal for long-term use, even in humid environments.

### Heat Efficiency

Brass burners distribute heat evenly, reducing burning or uneven cooking. This results in better control over your cooking process, ensuring your dishes are perfectly prepared.

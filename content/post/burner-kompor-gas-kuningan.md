## What is a Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

The **Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan** is a gas stove component made from brass (kuningan) that functions as the heat source during cooking.

## Key Features & Benefits of Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan

### Attractive Aesthetic

The golden hue of the brass burner adds a vintage charm to your cooking space. Whether your kitchen has a modern, rustic, or traditional theme, a kuningan burner complements various styles.

### Easy to Maintain

Cleaning a brass burner is straightforward. Regular wiping with a soft cloth and mild detergent helps maintain its shine and functionality. Additionally, brass is less prone to staining, making your cleaning routine easier.

### Compatibility

Most kuningan burners are compatible with standard gas fittings, making installation and replacement simple. This ensures convenience for users wanting to upgrade their existing stove or install a new burner.

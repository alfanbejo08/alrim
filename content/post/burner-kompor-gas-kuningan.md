## What is Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan refers to a cooking stove that features burners crafted from **kuningan** or brass, a metal alloy made primarily of copper and zinc. The term “Kuningan,” which means “brass” or “copper” in Indonesian, signifies the material used, renowned for its corrosion resistance, aesthetic appeal, and excellent heat conduction.

These burners have stood the test of time, often being passed down through generations, thanks to their durability and classic look. They are widely used in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, especially in traditional and modern kitchens seeking vintage charm with reliable performance.

The warm, golden hue of kuningan gives the stove a classic, luxurious look that enhances any kitchen decor. Its vintage charm makes it not just a functional appliance but also a decorative element.

Brass, the material used, is resistant to rust and corrosion, which means these burners can last for years—even decades—if maintained properly. Their sturdy construction withstands daily cooking demands.

### 3. Excellent Heat Conduction

Kuningan burners heat evenly, allowing for precise temperature control. This property is especially beneficial when cooking delicate dishes or requiring uniform heat distribution.

### 4. Easy to Maintain

## What is a Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

The phrase **"Kuningan"** refers to a particular type of brass or bronze alloy, renowned for its resistance to corrosion, heat, and aesthetic appeal.

## Why Choose Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

Kuningan alloy's inherent resistance to rust and corrosion means your burner will perform efficiently over time, even with regular use. Unlike standard stainless steel models, Kuningan burners are less prone to oxidation, which often leads to staining and degradation.

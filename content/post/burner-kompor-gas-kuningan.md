Kuningan, or brass, is a metal alloy consisting primarily of copper and zinc. Its use in gas burners adds significant advantages in terms of durability, heat conduction, and style. Here are some key reasons why a burner kompor gas kuningan is a popular choice:

The golden hue of kuningan adds a touch of elegance and classic charm to your kitchen setup. It pairs well with various kitchen styles, from modern minimalist to traditional rustic designs.

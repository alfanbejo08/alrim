## Considerations Before Buying a Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan

While this type of stove has many advantages, it’s important to consider certain factors to ensure it meets your needs.

- **Weight and Portability:** Brass is a heavy material, which makes the stove sturdy but less portable. If you need a portable option for outdoor cooking or camping, this may not be the best choice.
- **Cost:** Brass stoves tend to be more expensive than other materials like steel or aluminum due to the material's quality and aesthetic value.
- **Maintenance:** While easy to clean, brass can tarnish over time if not properly maintained. Regular polishing may be necessary to keep it looking new.

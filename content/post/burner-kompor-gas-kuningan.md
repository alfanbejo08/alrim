## What is Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

The Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan is a traditional style gas stove component made primarily from kuningan (brass). Known for its durability, corrosion resistance, and elegant appearance, kuningan has been a popular material in kitchen appliances in Indonesia and Southeast Asia for decades.

## Benefits of Using Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan

### 3. Excellent Heat Conduction

The thermal properties of kuningan ensure quick heating and even heat distribution. This results in efficient cooking, saving fuel and reducing cooking time.

### 4. Corrosion Resistance

Kuningan’s natural resistance to corrosion means the burner maintains its shine and structural integrity over the years, especially if properly maintained.

A simple cleaning routine using mild soap and a soft cloth is usually enough to keep the burner shiny and free from grease or stains. Some models may also feature decorative patterns that can be gently cleaned without damaging the design.

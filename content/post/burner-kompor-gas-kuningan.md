## What is a Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

A Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan is a traditional-style gas stove made primarily from kuningan (brass), giving it a distinctive golden hue and durable finish. Known for its heat conductivity and corrosion resistance, kuningan makes the burner highly durable and visually appealing. This type of stove is commonly used in Indonesian households, restaurants, and catering services that value both form and function.

The design of the Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan often features intricate detailing and a classic aesthetic, which adds a vintage charm to any kitchen decor. The burner itself usually includes a sturdy, easy-to-clean surface, making it suitable for high-frequency use.

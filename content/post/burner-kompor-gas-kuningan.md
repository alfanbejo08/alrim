Designed with a sturdy construction, the Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan features multiple burners, usually two or more, allowing for simultaneous cooking or boiling. Its brass material not only lends a vintage charm but also ensures resistance to corrosion and wear over time, making it a cost-effective investment.

## Benefits of Using Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan

## Considerations When Choosing Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan

While the benefits are compelling, it’s essential to also consider potential downsides to ensure it aligns with your needs.

### 1. Price Point  
Brass stoves tend to be more expensive than their steel counterparts due to material costs and craftsmanship. However, their longevity often justifies the initial investment.

### 2. Weight  
Kuningan or brass is a heavier material, making the stove more substantial and potentially harder to move. Ensure your kitchen setup can accommodate its weight.

## What Is a Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

A burner kompor gas kuningan is a gas stove made primarily from kuningan, a high-quality brass alloy renowned for its durability and corrosion resistance.

The brass material allows for efficient heat conduction and long-lasting use, making it a popular choice among Indonesian households and culinary enthusiasts.

## What is Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

The **Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan** is a traditional-style gas stove made predominantly from **kuningan** (brass).

These stoves are popular in Indonesian households and culinary establishments for their ability to withstand high cooking temperatures and their timeless design.

Typically, Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan features two or three burners, allowing simultaneous cooking of multiple dishes. Its sturdy construction ensures stability during use, and the use of brass makes it easier to clean and maintain over time.

## Key Features and Benefits

### 1. Durable and Long-lasting Material

Kuningan (brass) is highly resistant to rust and corrosion, making it ideal for frequent use in kitchens with high humidity. Its robustness ensures the stove remains functional and attractive for years.

### 2. Elegant Design

The warm golden hue of kuningan gives the stove a classic and luxurious look, enhancing the aesthetic of any kitchen. It pairs well with both traditional and modern kitchen setups.

Brass has excellent heat conduction properties, providing even heat distribution across the burners, which results in efficient cooking and better food taste.

Unlike some stainless steel stoves, kuningan is relatively easy to clean. A simple wipe with a damp cloth or brass cleaner keeps it shining and beautiful.

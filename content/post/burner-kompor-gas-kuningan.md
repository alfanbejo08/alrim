## What Is a Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

A burner kompor gas kuningan is a gas stove burner crafted primarily from kuningan (brass). Brass is celebrated for its excellent heat conduction, corrosion resistance, and aesthetic appeal.

Kuningan (brass) is a metal alloy composed mainly of copper and zinc, making it highly durable and resistant to rust. This ensures your gas burner remains in excellent condition even after years of daily use.

Brass burners heat up quickly and distribute heat evenly across the cooking surface. This results in more precise cooking, reducing the risk of burn spots and uneven cooking.

### 3. Elegant Design
The warm golden hue of kuningan adds a touch of sophistication to any kitchen setting. Its classic design blends well with traditional and modern interior decor.

### 4. Compatibility with Multiple Gas Types
Most kuningan burners work well with LPG or natural gas, providing flexibility based on the availability and preference.

### 5. Easy to Maintain
The brass surface is relatively easy to clean. Regular wiping with a damp cloth helps maintain its shine and prevents tarnishing.

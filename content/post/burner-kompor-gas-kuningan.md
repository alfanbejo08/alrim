## Benefits of Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan

### Durability and Longevity

One of the main attractions of Kuningan burners is their robustness. Brass is a corrosion-resistant material, ensuring that your stove remains functional and visually appealing for years. Unlike cheaper materials that may rust or warp over time, brass burners withstand exposure to moisture and heat without significant deterioration.

### Excellent Heat Conduction

Kuningan or brass has superior heat conduction properties, allowing the flame to distribute evenly across your cookware. This feature results in efficient cooking, saving fuel and reducing cooking time.

Brass burners are straightforward to clean. Regular wiping with a damp cloth and occasional polishing maintain their shine. Unlike stainless steel, brass doesn't easily show fingerprints or smudges, keeping your stove looking pristine.

## Drawbacks of Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan

While brass burners have many advantages, they are not without some limitations.

### Higher Price Point

Compared to stainless steel or aluminum burners, brass burners tend to be more expensive upfront. The quality craftsmanship and materials contribute to this higher cost.

### Heavier Weight

Brass is a dense material, making the burners heavier than other options. This can pose challenges during installation or cleaning.

### Potential Tarnishing

Over time, brass can develop a patina or tarnish if not properly maintained. Although polishing can restore its shine, it requires regular upkeep.

### Compatibility Issues

Some cheaper models may not fit standard stove sizes or configurations, so it's essential to verify compatibility before purchasing.

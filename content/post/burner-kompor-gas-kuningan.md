Kuningan or brass material is known for its exceptional durability.

When properly maintained, a burner made of kuningan can last for years without significant wear and tear.

### 2. Excellent Heat Conduction

Brass effectively distributes heat evenly across the cooking surface, reducing hot spots that can burn food. This ensures your dishes are cooked uniformly, saving time and energy.

### 3. Elegant and Traditional Aesthetic

With its warm golden hue, a **Kuningan** burner adds a touch of traditional elegance to your kitchen decor. It is often chosen by those who appreciate classic craftsmanship and timeless design.

### 4. Easy to Maintain

Kuningan burners are relatively easy to clean. Regular wiping with a soft cloth and occasional polishing can keep them looking new and functioning optimally.

### 5. Cost-Effective

Compared to other high-end materials, brass burners are generally more affordable while still providing excellent quality and performance.

## What Is a Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

The burner kompor gas kuningan is a type of gas stove made primarily of kuningan (brass), a metal known for its durability, corrosion resistance, and excellent heat conduction. These burners feature open flames fueled by liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or natural gas, making them ideal for various cooking needs. Their traditional design often includes single or double burners, with some models incorporating adjustable flame settings for precise cooking control.

Kuningan, or brass, is a favored material because it withstands high temperatures and offers a long lifespan with minimal maintenance. Moreover, its aesthetic appeal lends a rustic, vintage charm to any kitchen. Many households, especially in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, prefer this type of burner for its affordability, robustness, and traditional feel.

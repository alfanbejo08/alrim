Known for its longevity and excellent heat conduction, Kuningan has been used traditionally in culinary settings and is now incorporated into modern gas stoves for both functional and aesthetic reasons. The burner is usually made from high-quality brass, providing durability, corrosion resistance, and an elegant appearance.

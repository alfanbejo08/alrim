## What is Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?  

The **Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan** is a gas stove with burners crafted from **kuningan** — the Indonesian word for brass.

Brass, or kuningan, is known for its resistance to corrosion and rust, making it a long-lasting investment. Unlike some steel or stainless steel burners, kuningan can withstand moisture and high temperatures without losing its shine or integrity.  

### 3. Excellent Heat Conduction  

Kuningan has superior thermal properties, allowing the burners to heat evenly and efficiently. This results in better cooking performance, whether you're simmering delicate sauces or stir-frying vegetables.

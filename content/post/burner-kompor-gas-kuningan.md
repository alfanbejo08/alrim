## What is a Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

The **Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan** is a traditional-style gas stove made primarily from kuningan (brass), a material known for its durability, corrosion resistance, and attractive golden hue. These stoves are crafted either manually or semi-automatically, combining classic design elements with contemporary features, making them suitable for both traditional and modern kitchens.

Typically, these burners feature a sturdy metal build, an easy-to-clean surface, and reliable gas ignition systems. Their craftsmanship often highlights intricate detailing, adding an elegant touch to your cooking space. Popular in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, these stoves are favored for their robustness and cultural significance.

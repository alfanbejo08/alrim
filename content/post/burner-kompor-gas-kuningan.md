## What is a Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

A **Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan** is a gas stove with a burner made from **kuningan (brass)**, a metal alloy known for its excellent thermal conductivity, durability, and corrosion resistance.

## Why Choose a Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

Kuningan or brass is highly resistant to rust and corrosion, ensuring your stove remains in prime condition even after years of use. Unlike steel burners, brass is less susceptible to oxidation, extending the lifespan of your appliance.

### 3. Aesthetic Appeal

The golden hue of kuningan adds a vintage yet elegant look to your kitchen. Its classic appearance complements both modern and traditional kitchen designs, making it a versatile addition to your culinary space.

### 4. Easy Maintenance

Brass burners are relatively easy to clean, requiring only regular wiping with a soft cloth and mild cleaning agents. Their resistance to corrosion means you won’t have to worry about rust stains or discoloration.

### 5. Cost-Effective

Compared to other premium materials, kuningan provides excellent value for money. Its durability reduces replacement costs, and its energy efficiency can help lower your gas bills over time.

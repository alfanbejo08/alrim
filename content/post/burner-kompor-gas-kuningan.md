## What Is Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

**Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan** refers to a gas stove burner crafted from high-quality kuningan (brass).

### 3. Excellent Heat Conduction

Kuningan’s thermal properties allow for quick heating and even heat distribution, which is essential for preparing dishes perfectly without hot spots or uneven cooking.

### 4. Easy Maintenance

Cleaning is straightforward—simply wipe down with a damp cloth and mild detergent. Kuningan resists rust and tarnishing, reducing the need for frequent replacements.

### 5. Compatibility

Burner Gas Kuningan is compatible with various types of gas cylinders and can be used with different cookware sizes. Its solid construction ensures stability during cooking.

## What is Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

**Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan** refers to a gas stove burner made primarily from kuningan, a type of brass alloy known for its durability and corrosion resistance.

## Why Choose Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

Kuningan burners are easy to clean with simple damp cloths and mild detergents. Their smooth surface and corrosion resistance mean they won't quickly tarnish or accumulate residues, simplifying regular maintenance.

### Cost-Effective

Compared to more modern or stainless steel alternatives, kuningan burners are generally more affordable, providing a balance between cost and quality. They are suitable for budget-conscious consumers who do not want to compromise on durability.

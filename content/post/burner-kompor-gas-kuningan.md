## What is a Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

A burner kompor gas kuningan is a type of gas stove featuring burners made from kuningan, the Indonesian word for brass. Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc, renowned for its excellent heat conduction, corrosion resistance, and durability. These qualities make brass burners ideal for high-temperature cooking and long-term use.

Typically, burner kompor gas kuningan consists of a sturdy frame, multiple burners, and knobs for controlling the gas flow. The brass burners are designed to distribute heat evenly, ensuring efficient cooking results. This type of stove is widely used in households, warungs (small eateries), and professional kitchens across Indonesia and Southeast Asia.

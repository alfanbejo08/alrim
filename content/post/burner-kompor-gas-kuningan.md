## Benefits of Using Kompor Gas Kuningan

### 1. Excellent Heat Conduction

Brass's superior thermal conductivity ensures even heat distribution during cooking. This results in more efficient cooking processes, reducing fuel consumption and improving outcomes, especially for dishes that require precise temperature control.

### 2. Durable and Corrosion-Resistant

Brass is known for its durability and resistance to rust and corrosion. A ku ningan stove can withstand regular usage in humid environments without significant degradation of its materials.

The golden hue of brass adds a vintage or luxurious touch to your kitchen decor. Its classic look complements traditional and modern kitchen themes, making it not just a practical device, but also a decorative element.

### 4. Easy to Clean

Most brass burners are designed with smooth surfaces that are easy to wipe down. With proper maintenance, they can stay looking shiny and new for years.

### 5. Cost-Effective

Compared to high-end stainless steel or ceramic stoves, brass burners are often more affordable while providing excellent performance.

## Drawbacks of Kompor Gas Kuningan

### 1. Prone to Tarnishing

While brass is corrosion-resistant, it can tarnish over time, especially if not maintained properly. Regular cleaning and polishing are necessary to maintain its shiny appearance.

### 2. Heavier Weight

Brass components tend to be heavier than other materials like aluminum or stainless steel, making the stove slightly less portable.

### 3. Potential for Hot Spots

To keep the brass looking attractive, periodic polishing and cleaning are necessary. Neglecting maintenance can lead to discoloration or buildup of grime.

## What is Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan?

**Burner Kompor Gas Kuningan** refers to a type of gas stove with burners made from or coated with kuningan, an alloy of copper and zinc known for its durability and attractive golden color. The term "Kuningan" signifies the distinct yellowish hue, which adds a vintage or classic aesthetic to your kitchen.

These stoves are popular in Indonesian households and small eateries due to their robust build and elegant appearance. The burners are often designed with multiple flame settings, allowing for versatile cooking modes, and are compatible with standard LPG or gas cylinders.

## Key Features and Benefits
